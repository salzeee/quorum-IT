# Quorum IT Web Page

This is a web page built using Vite, a fast and opinionated build tool for modern web development. It utilizes React as the frontend framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command in terminal:

```
npm install
```

### Development Server

To start the development server and run the project locally, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application on a local development server and provide you with a URL (e.g.,  http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to access the page in your browser. The development server includes hot module replacement (HMR), which allows you to see the changes you make in real-time without having to manually reload the page.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production deployment, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized and minified version of your application in the `dist` directory. You can take the files from the `dist` directory and deploy them to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the landing page according to your needs. You can modify the content, styles, and structure by editing the relevant files in the project. The components folder contains different sections of the web page, such as About, Contact, Navbar, Services, Slider, and Whyus. The assets folder contains all the necessary images used in the web page.
