# Quorum IT Web Page

This is web page built using Vite, a fast and opinionated build tool for modern web development. It utilizes React as the frontend framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Installation

### Navigate to the project directory and open terminal:

2. npm install

### To start the development server and run the project locally, use the following command:

3.npm run dev

This will launch the application on a local development server and provide you with a URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to access the page in your browser. The development server includes hot module replacement (HMR), which allows you to see the changes you make in real-time without having to manually reload the page.

## Building for Production

This will create an optimized and minified version of your application in the dist directory. You can take the files from the dist directory and deploy them to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.
